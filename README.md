## How to setup

---

### <u>**1. Downloading**</u>

##### <u>Option 1 - Clone the repository</u>

Using _git_ -

-   ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/damushypotato/p5js-Project-Template.git
    ```

Or using _GitHub CLI_ -

-   ```shell
    gh repo clone damushypotato/p5js-Project-Template
    ```

##### <u>Option 2 - Download zip</u>

-   Click here - [`⬇ Zip`](https://github.com/damushypotato/p5js-Project-Template/archive/master.zip)

    > (If that doesn't work - Click on the green `⬇ Code` button at the top and select `Download ZIP`)

---

### <u>2. Setup</u>

You don't really need any setup so apart from some optional things I added so you can straight away jump into the `app.js` and start writing your p5.js code! Just keep in mind that you will need to host a local webserver to develop your app properly.

##### <u>_Optional settings_</u>

-   GitHub Repository Button

    1. Open the `settings.json`.

    2. Paste _your_ GitHub repository link in the `github-repo` key.

        Now whenever you click on the GitHub Repository button, it will redirect you to the url you pasted.
